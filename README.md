# Fine Dining Restaurant Project
This repository contains the code for the frontend of a web application built using ReactJS. The aim of this project is to create a beautiful and intuitive user interface for a fine dining restaurant.

# Features
The frontend was designed with responsiveness and accessibility in mind, so customers can access the site on any device and with any accessibility requirements.

# Code organization
I have put in a lot of effort to ensure the code is well-organized, readable and maintainable, with clear documentation throughout. The code is organized into different components, each responsible for a specific feature or functionality of the web application.
