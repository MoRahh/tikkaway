A Fine Dining Restaurant

This repository contains the code for the frontend of a web application built using ReactJS.
My aim was to create a beautiful and intuitive user interface. In this project, you will find a range of features that enable customers to view The menu, find information about The restaurant and so on.
The Frontend was designed with responsiveness and accessibility in mind, so The customers can access The site on any device and with any accessibility requirements.
I hope you find My code to be well-organized and easy to understand. I have put in a lot of effort to ensure the code is readable and maintainable, with clear documentation throughout.
